This is a pie timer made with CSS3.
It is derived from the artical(http://css-tricks.com/css-pie-timer/) from css-tricks.com

I wrote a blog in Chinese to describe the process and related background knowledges. The blog URL is http://www.haowu.info/2012/08/06/using-css3-to-create-a-dynamic-pie-timer/
